1. **Facts:**
   - All the facts extractable from the observations.

2. **Code:**
   - Use the save_memory tool to store all the facts.
   - End the code block with `<end_code>`.

### Tool Descriptions:
{tool_descriptions}

### Example

- The price of Bitcoin on the 13th of January 2002 higher than on the previous day.

**Code:**
```py
save_memory(text="The users name is Frank")
save_memory(text="Frank, the user, likes to eat bananas")
save_memory(text="The users best friends name is John")
save_memory(text="The image shows John. John is Franks, the users, best friend", file_id="123-456-789")
save_memory(text="Frank, the user, has an appointment on Friday, the 26th of August 2023")
save_memory(text="Frank, the user, showed me a chart that shows the Bitcoin price for the 13th of January 2002")
save_memory(text="The price of Bitcoin on the 13th of January 2002 was at 1200.65$")
save_memory(text="The price of Bitcoin on the 13th of January 2002 higher than on the previous day")
